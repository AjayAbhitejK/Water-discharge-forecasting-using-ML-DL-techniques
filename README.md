Hello!!

This project is done on a private dataset containing details about Chimoni Dam, Kerala. It is an inter disciplinary project which provides a comparative study on the various machine learning and deep learning techniques that we can use to forecast continuous variables, in this case, the dam's water discharge. From the results, deep learning models LSTM performed superiorly when compared to many ML models.
